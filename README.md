A collection of utilities and notebooks for analysing your finances.

I found the tools available online to be black boxes that were usually not as configurable as I would have liked.
This is what lead me to create the tools you'll find in this repository. The notebooks available are:

- [Student Loan](student_loan.ipynb) can be used to estimate:
  - If your student loan will be written off
  - The effects of making extra repayments on your total amount repaid

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can either:

- Clone this repo and run the notebooks locally
- Open this repository directly in Google Colab <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/HMellor/personal-finance-uk">
